# Install vite

npm init -y
```

```
npm install --save-dev vite phaser firebase
```

```
npm start
```

### OLD INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

### **Phaser does not have an IDE or working environment like a game engine, it is a library.**

You should just be editing the code via VS Code or whatever editor of your choosing.

THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW ARE FOR OLD BUILD. USE TO THE npm COMMANDS FOR THE LATEST BUILDS. 

To actually run the project, you just need to boot it as a webserver. For example, heres the easiest way (with python): in terminal, CD to the directory of the project, then just start a local server

```
cd C:\Users\Janak\Desktop\Info4235Game

python -m http.server 8000
```

Then on your browser, you would open:

```

http://localhost:8000/index.html

```
