# READ THIS IF YOUR TRYING TO WORK ON YOUR OWN MACHINE

### The game already has the necessary files for phaser included via phaser.js

### **Phaser does not have an IDE or working environment like a game engine, it is a library.**

You should just be editing the code via VS Code or whatever editor of your choosing.

To actually run the project, you just need to boot it as a webserver. For example, in terminal, CD to the directory of the project, then just start a local server

```
cd C:\Users\Janak\Desktop\Info4235Game

python -m http.server 8000
```

Then on your browser, you would open:

```

http://localhost:8000/index.html

```

## And voila, game should open in browser. Im assuming i dont gotta explain how to connect git but if u confused just ask on the discord
